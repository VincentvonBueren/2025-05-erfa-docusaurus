# üìò ipt Documentation

This is the **internal documentation site for ipt**, built to explore and test [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).  
It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with documentation structure, theming, and developer onboarding.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
````

> Requires **Node.js ‚â• 18**.

### 2. Start Local Development

```bash
npm run start
```

This starts the site locally at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

‚ö†Ô∏è **Heads up**: Full-text search does **not work** in development mode.
To test search, you‚Äôll need to build the production site and serve it (see below).

---

## üì¶ Build and Serve Production

```bash
npm run build
npx serve build
```

This will generate the static site in the `build/` directory and start a local production server.
‚úÖ **Search will work** in this mode.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Using with Devbox

If you use [Devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/) to set up the environment:

```bash
devbox shell
npm install
```

Then you can run:

```bash
npm run start     # Local dev server (no search)
npm run build     # Production build
npx serve build   # Serve production site with working search
```

To leave the Devbox shell:

```bash
exit
```
